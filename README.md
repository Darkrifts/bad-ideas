# bad-ideas
Where everything I make falls into

Like, seriously, nothing in here should be used as a
serious solution to problems, but if nothing else works...

# Notes
In languages where everything must be in a class (C#, Java)
it is implicitly in a class of the same name as the file.

For example, EntropicCompress.cs is in the class EntopicCompress

Anyone can add anything to this repository, so long as the name is
included in the file name (if left out, it is implied to be Darkrifts)

Such as SomePerson.SomeFile.SomeExtension
